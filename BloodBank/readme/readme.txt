I used multiple libraries in my project.
1) jQuery ---> help to do some tasks more easily and effeciently.
2) Angular Material ---> It have some package which are good for drag and drop task to perform. Example CdkDragStart, CdkDragMove, CdkDragDrop, moveItemInArray, copyArrayItem, transferArrayItem
3) bootstrap and CSS ---> To make page more responsive.
